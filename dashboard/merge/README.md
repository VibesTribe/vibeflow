# Vibeflow Dashboard Merge System

This folder is used to build *hybrid dashboards* by combining components
(progress bars, headers, dropdowns, task views, etc.) from multiple versions
without overwriting originals.

Refer to `templates/manifest.sample.json` and `manifest_checklist.md` for guidance.
