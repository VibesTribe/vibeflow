# Runtime State

JSON snapshots generated by orchestrator, supervisor, and telemetry writers.

- `openspec.index.json` — maintained by `npm run context:openspec`.
- `assignment.log.json`, `task.state.json`, etc. — to be produced by orchestrator/telemetry slices.

Use `npm run pages:sync` to mirror this directory (and `../metrics`) into `docs/state/` for GitHub Pages.
